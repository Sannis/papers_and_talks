== Final work for CS MSU Supercomputing cources


== Mission

This work includes the implementation of various algorithms for solving equations of diffraction of the laser beam
in the medium with cubic nonlinearity and comparing their effectiveness.
The main goal -- to find the speed of each algorithm depending on such factors as size of the matrix, the number of processes, the accuracy of the result.
